## About Me

From a young age, I've had a deep curiosity about how things work and how they can be made better. My early years were spent with Legos, Knex, Erector Sets, and model rockets. If an appliance or electronic device broke, I was the one taking it apart to understand it inside and out.

This natural curiosity has evolved into a holistic approach to problem-solving, allowing me to see challenges from multiple angles. With a strong background in construction, I’m now transitioning into the world of computer programming. My goal is to harness these skills to create solutions that contribute to social justice and environmental stewardship.

I’m always open to collaborating with others who share these passions. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn by clicking the icon—let’s work together toward meaningful progress.
